# Countdown to 100K

This is a YouTube subscriber countdown app that tracks progress toward 100,000 subscribers by estimating how long (in years, months and days) until you will hit 100K subscribers! 

## Background
I initially created this project using Funnel to connect to the YouTube API and get an estimate for my own YouTube channel, Ray's Ukulele. At the time I was very excited to see that given my current trajectory I would hit 100K subscribers in about 25 years. Now that I am learning to code, I decided to recreate this project but connect to the YouTube API myself and make it so that other users could check their countdown as well. As soon as I get the app approved by Google, I will share it to the reddit r/NewTubers community to let new YouTubers see how long until they hit 100K subscribers. 

## How to Run
This is actually live on https://ray-banks.com/countdown-to-100k so you can go there and try it out!
